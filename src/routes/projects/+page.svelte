            <h3>Tanks! (Python)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For this project I recreated the classic Wii Play tanks game using pygame's GUI in python. 
                    This project really helped me put an object oriented programming style into practice as 
                    each tank, projectile, landmine, and even block you see in this game was 
                    represented using an object of a class. I created a structure of inheritance 
                    from a base 'Tank' class with several subclasses such as 'MovingEnemyTank' and 
                    even more specific subclasses such as 'RedTank' to account the the different 
                    abilities that each of my 5 enemy tanks had. I also had to create physics in 
                    this game focusing especially on the bouncing of projectiles along borders and 
                    blocks of each level as well as rotating said projectile's image to the correct 
                    direction each time they were shot or bounced. In addition, I was able to 
                    incorporate the A* pathfinding method into this program so that CPU tanks could 
                    move towards the player through the various level maps. Another feature I 
                    implemented was loading levels through a json file, which made adding new 
                    levels much quicker and easier. Lastly, I got to have some fun adding background 
                    music and sound effects that matched those in the original game.

            <h3>FPGA based pipelined datapath with searching algorithm (MIPS, Verilog)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I collaborated with a group to design, implement, and validate a five-stage pipelined datapath for the MIPS 32-bit ISA 
                    on the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. This datapath design included hazarding and forwarding from both the instruction decode and 
                    execution stages (forwarding is not shown on this diagram). In addition, we implemented an image processing algorithm in MIPS ISA and executed 
                    on the FPGA based emulation of the pipelined processor on the FPGA.

            <h3>Flappy Bird (Python)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For this project, I created a Flappy Bird game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.
                     This game allowed me to experiment with creating physics behind my jumping/flying,
                      as well as creating hitboxes and dealing with collisions between objects. In 
                      addition, I created a method to randomize the location of the pipes each time 
                      they were generated. Lastly, I was able to add a scoreboard that keeps track of 
                      both your highest and current score, as well as a simple medal system that appears 
                      depending on your score.

            <h3>AidanGPT (html/css/javascript)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For this project, I created a "copy" of the well known AI called ChatGPT. For
                    the frontend and display I used HTML and CSS to style and create the base for
                    this chat AI. Then, I used Javascript to call to OpenAI's API for ChatGPT and
                    to create new text objects that can be displayed as the user and the AI interact.
                    It was interesting to be able to create my own version of this AI by simply
                    calling to their API, and I should be able to apply this same concept to other Projects
                    in order to further improve them.

            <ul>
                <li>This website in itself is a personal project of mine. I made it using a combination of html 
                    and css. I wanted to start working on some more frontend type of programming work and this project
                    was a great start towards that goal. I initially had lots of difficulty organizing the website the 
                    way I wanted it, but once I better understood how to use flexbox in css to align, organize, and group different
                    content I was able to successfully create the website how I wanted. Lastly, I was able to add just a 
                    small bit of javascript in order to create a clickable dropdown menu for mobile devices.

            <h3>Tic Tac Toe (Python)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This Tic Tac Toe game was a personal project of mine. I wanted to create a game with
                    a graphical user interface to play it on. I also wanted to experiment with creating
                    a sort of AI that would make smart decisions based on the previous and currently available
                    moves. Thus, I created this Tic Tac Toe game using python. In addition to my goals with this
                    project, I got to practice writing code in a more object oriented way, and I was able to
                    expose myself to a new python module in tkinter.

                <li>
                    After completing my AidanGPT Project, I added an additional difficulty mode in my Tic Tac Toe game
                    called ChatGPT AI Mode. This mode calls to ChatGPT using an API so that the user is playing against
                    a true AI. This was a fun way to apply my new experience in openai's API even though it turns out ChatGPT
                    is not very good at Tic Tac Toe.

            <ul>
                <li>This program was done as a project for my computer programming in engineering
                        applications II class. This program takes several inputs, primarily direction
                        and velocity, in order to simulate the position and state of a moving car. 
                        This program is a great representation of my ability to use object oriented 
                        programming and create a program which can vary greatly depending on the input data.

            <ul>
                <li>In this project I worked within a group of 4 people in order to construct a device
                        that rotates a solar panel towards the sun in order for it to be of maximum 
                        effectiveness. I focused on programming the arduino to control the motor which
                        rotated the system. I did this by reading the change in voltage caused by the 
                        photoresistors as they were exposed to more or less light. I then programmed the 
                        motor to rotate accordingly in the direction which was determined to be of greater sunlight.
